Step-by-Step Guide
1. Setting Up the Environment
Definition: Environment setup involves creating an isolated Python environment and installing necessary dependencies to ensure project consistency and reproducibility.

Detailed Explanation:

A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages. Using a virtual environment allows you to manage project-specific dependencies, regardless of what dependencies every other project has.
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 -m venv venv: This command creates a new virtual environment named "venv" in the current directory.
source venv/bin/activate: This activates the virtual environment. On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate.
pip install -r requirements.txt: This installs all the Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

The requirements.txt file should include all necessary libraries, such as:
PyMuPDF==1.19.0
nltk==3.6.2
spacy==3.1.0
scikit-learn==0.24.2
pandas==1.3.0
matplotlib==3.4.2
seaborn==0.11.1
